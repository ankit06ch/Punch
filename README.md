🥊 Punch — Powering Loyalty for Local Businesses

Punch is a cross-platform mobile app that connects small businesses through a shared rewards network, allowing them to unite, reward customers, and grow together — without needing to build their own loyalty infrastructure.

✨ Think: earn points at your favorite local coffee shop, redeem them at the pizza place next door.
🎯 It’s community-powered loyalty — built for small businesses, not tech giants.

🧠 Why Punch?

Big brands like Starbucks dominate customer loyalty through sleek, digital-first tools. Meanwhile, small businesses are stuck with:
	•	❌ Paper punch cards
	•	❌ Disconnected systems
	•	❌ High-cost, low-return loyalty apps

Punch flips the script.
Instead of competing alone, small businesses can now team up in one unified loyalty network. It’s not just an app — it’s a movement to put power back in the hands of local communities.
